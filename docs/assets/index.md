# Hierarchical Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization

Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) is an advanced portfolio optimization framework introduced by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado in 2016.
Unlike traditional methods like Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), HRP leverages hierarchical clustering and recursive bisection
to allocate assets without requiring the inversion of the covariance matrix, enhancing robustness against estimation errors.
