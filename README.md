# 🎯 Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) Portfolio Optimization

Welcome to **HRP Portfolio**, a robust, real-world ready Python framework implementing the cutting-edge **Hierarchical Risk Parity** methodology for portfolio allocation.  
Forget the instability of traditional Modern Portfolio Theory — HRP leverages clustering, hierarchy, and smart bisection for resilient asset allocation without inverting noisy covariance matrices.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Reliable asset ordering based on correlation distances.
- **Robust Recursive Bisection**: Natural risk-based allocation without fragile optimizations.
- **Modular Design**: Each logic block cleanly separated into individual modules.
- **Real-World Ready**: Scales efficiently to large asset universes.

## 📈 Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hrp-portfolio.git
   cd hrp-portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scipy
   ```

3. Prepare your asset return data in `returns.csv`:
   - Rows = Dates
   - Columns = Asset symbols
   - Values = Periodic returns

4. Run the optimizer:
   ```bash
   python run_hrp.py
   ```

5. Admire the clean, hierarchical, risk-balanced portfolio weights! 🚀

## 📚 Theory Behind HRP
Traditional optimizations (e.g., Mean-Variance) struggle under real-world conditions: noisy covariance matrices, estimation error, and ill-behaved inversions.  
HRP bypasses these issues using:
- Distance metrics derived from correlations
- Hierarchical clustering to impose an asset hierarchy
- Recursive bisection based on cluster variances

Result: more stable, interpretable, and resilient portfolios.
